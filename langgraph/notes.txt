langchain is like simple way of creating agents, some times it may falls into infinite loop because 
 when we given a prompt like "give me the todays weather" int has 2 tools like today time and tavilysearchresults
 but when we give only one tool it may fall into loop like { 1.think,2.action,3.observation } so, 
 to over come this 
  --> langgraph came into the picture to reduce this complex looping like dynamically providing 
 how many time we have to loop the agent. And the main thing of langgraph is it has 4 core components like 
 1.node 
 2.edge--->connection of two nodes called edge.
 3.conditional edge.----> it tells whether it goes into the loop or it has to end the execution of loop.
 4.state ---> reserving or maintaining the update or changes done by the nodes.


----> Reflection Agent pattern in langgraph
A reflection agent pattern is an ai system pattern that can look at its own outputs and think about them 
or make it better just like how we look at ourselves in a mirror and self react make ourselves better.
--> basic reflection system consists of:
1) A generator agent
2) A reflector agent


---->reflection agent is not grounded with the live data and it could be hallucinate or outdated content 
and we have no way of knowing because it not have access to the tools and llm is limit with training data.
REFLEXION AGENT system is address this drawback

---->The Reflexion agent similar to the reflection agent not only critics its own responses but also
 fact checks it with external data by making api calls or Internet search.
 -->in the reflection agent pattern we had to rely on the training data of Llm's but in this case
  we are not limited to that.
